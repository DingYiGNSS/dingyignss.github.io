### Project Overview
This project focuses on the **monitoring and modelling of global and regional ionospheric conditions** to support next-generation **high-precision GNSS positioning services**. The primary objective is to develop **advanced ionospheric modelling techniques** that enable **centimeter-level Precise Point Positioning with Ambiguity Resolution (PPP-AR)** for real-time and near-real-time applications.

The project is conducted in close collaboration with **Hexagon NovAtel**, leveraging their global GNSS infrastructure and expertise in high-precision positioning systems.

### Technical Contributions
- Leading the **development of real-time PPP-AR GNSS processing software** with support for **multi-station, multi-site architectures**.
- Achieved **horizontal positioning accuracy better than 2.5 cm at the 95th percentile** using **IGS GNSS station data**.
- Designed and implemented **multi-model ionospheric delay estimation frameworks** combining:
  - PPP-AR strategies  
  - Geometry-free and geometry-based modelling approaches  
  - External ionospheric constraints
- Developed **global and regional ionospheric delay products**, including:
  - **Global Ionospheric Models (GIMs)**  
  - **Regional Ionospheric Models (RIMs)**

  ### Key Outcomes
- Real-time **PPP-AR software system** capable of supporting large-scale GNSS networks.
- High-resolution **global and regional ionospheric products** suitable for operational PPP-RTK services.
- Demonstrated feasibility of **centimeter-level positioning performance** under realistic global GNSS network conditions.
- Provided a strong technical foundation for **commercial-grade high-precision GNSS services** based on NovAtel infrastructure.
