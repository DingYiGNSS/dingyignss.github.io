### Project Overview
The GISCAD-OV project aims to support the **development, validation, and real-world assessment of Galileo High Accuracy Service (HAS)** for professional and mass-market applications, with a particular focus on **cadastral and land administration services**.

Within this project, the York University team contributed to the **algorithmic development and performance evaluation of GNSS Precise Point Positioning (PPP) solutions enhanced by Galileo HAS corrections**, emphasizing realistic vehicle-based and low-cost sensor scenarios.

---

### Technical Contributions
- Contributed to the **implementation and refinement of PPP processing algorithms incorporating Galileo HAS corrections**.
- Conducted a **comprehensive performance assessment of low-cost GNSS PPP solutions** enabled by HAS.
- Performed detailed **comparative analyses between Galileo HAS PPP and real-time CNES PPP ultra-rapid products**.
- Evaluated positioning accuracy, convergence behavior, and robustness under **realistic driving environments**, including urban and semi-urban scenarios.

---

### Key Outcomes
- Validated the **practical applicability of Galileo HAS corrections** for low-cost and mass-market GNSS positioning.
- Delivered algorithmic and experimental results supporting **future adoption of HAS-enabled PPP solutions**.
- Contributed technical findings to the broader **European GNSS service validation framework** under the GISCAD-OV initiative.
