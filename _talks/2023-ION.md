I participated in **ION GNSS+ 2023**, held in Denver, USA, where I presented **two conference papers** focusing on smartphone-based GNSS positioning and multisensor integration in realistic driving environments.

The first paper, **“Hybridization of Smartphone GNSS PPP/RTK with Native IMU in Realistic Driving Scenarios”**.

This paper received the **ION GNSS+ 2023 Student Paper Award**, a highly competitive international award granted annually to only **4–5 papers worldwide**, recognizing outstanding student-led research contributions.
