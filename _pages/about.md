## About Me

I am currently an **Associate Professor** with the **[School of Geospatial Engineering and Science](https://sges.sysu.edu.cn/geodesy/en)** at **[Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/)**, China, and a former Postdoctoral Fellow with the **[Earth and Space Science and Engineering Department at York University](https://gnsslab.lassonde.yorku.ca/)**. I received my Ph.D. degree in 2024, following earlier training in geomatics engineering in China and Germany.

My research aims to improve the **accuracy, reliability, and robustness** of navigation systems, particularly for applications involving **low-cost and smartphone sensors and urban environments**.

I am continuously recruiting motivated **M.Sc. and Ph.D. students** and warmly welcome opportunities for academic and industrial collaboration. Please feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:yiding@mail.sysu.edu.cn).
