## About Me

I specialize in **GNSS-based navigation and positioning**, with a focus on
**advanced GNSS positioning techniques and low-cost multisensor fusion** for
robust vehicle navigation in challenging environments.

I am currently a **Postdoctoral Fellow** with the **Earth and Space Science and
Engineering Department, York University**, Toronto, Canada. I received my Ph.D.
degree in 2024, following earlier training in geomatics engineering in China and
Germany.

My research aims to improve the **accuracy, reliability, and robustness of
navigation systems**, particularly for applications involving low-cost sensors
and urban environments.

I welcome opportunities for **academic and industrial collaboration**.  
Please feel free to reach out via email.
