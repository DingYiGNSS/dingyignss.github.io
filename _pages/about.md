## About Me

I am currently a **Postdoctoral Fellow** with the Earth and Space Science and Engineering Department, York University, Toronto, Canada. I received my Ph.D. degree in 2024, following earlier training in geomatics engineering in China and Germany.

My research aims to improve the **accuracy, reliability, and robustness** of navigation systems, particularly for applications involving **low-cost and smartphone sensors and urban environments**.

I welcome opportunities for **academic and industrial collaboration**. Please feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:yd8061150@outlook.com).
