abstract: "The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) capability in smartphones has seen significant upgrades over the years. The latest ultra-low-cost GNSS receivers are capable of carrier-phase tracking and multi-constellation, dual-frequency signal reception. However, due to the limitations of these ultra-low-cost receivers and antennas, smartphone GNSS position solutions suffer significantly from urban multipath, poor signal reception, and signal blockage. This paper presents a novel sensor fusion technique using Precise Point Positioning (PPP) and the inertial sensors in smartphones, combined with a single- and dual-frequency (SFDF) optimisation scheme for smartphones. The smartphone is field-tested while attached to a vehicle’s dashboard and is driven in multiple real-world situations. A total of five vehicle experiments were conducted and the solutions show that SFDF-PPP outperforms single-frequency PPP (SF-PPP) and dual-frequency PPP (DF-PPP). Solutions can be further improved by integrating with native smartphone IMU measurements and provide consistent horizontal positioning accuracy of <2 m rms through a variety obstructions. These results show a significant improvement from the existing literature using similar hardware in challenging environments. Future work will improve optimising inertial sensor calibration and integrate additional sensors."
