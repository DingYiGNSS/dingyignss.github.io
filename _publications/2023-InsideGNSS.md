abstract: "In January 2023, EUSPA oﬀicially announced the Galileo High Accuracy Service (HAS) reached initial service through the E6B signal [1]. With the availability of HAS data, users worldwide can retrieve precise GPS+Galileo orbit and clock corrections, as well as satellite code biases in real-time and for free with 24/7 operated service delivery and committed performance levels. This trend has further boosted the development of GNSS receivers and mass-market applications, such as Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), precise agriculture and mobile mapping [2]. While there has been a growing interest in assessing the performance of Galileo HAS in Precise Point Positioning (PPP) processing mode for civil applications, there has yet to be an investigation into the use of low-cost sensor data with HAS corrections in urban driving environments. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of Galileo HAS PPP in real-world driving conditions using low-cost GNSS and IMU sensors."
