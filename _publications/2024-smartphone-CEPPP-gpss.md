abstract: "High received signal noise and limited multipath suppression capabilities cannot be neglected when it comes to smartphone-grade GNSS receivers and antennas and, along with frequent carrier-phase measurement discontinuities and losses, pose a challenge for advanced GNSS positioning techniques. To effectively utilize all satellite measurements in the absence of phase measurements, we proposed a pseudorange-only measurement enhanced PPP method with single- and dual-frequency combinations. In other words, the enhanced PPP utilizes the satellites with pseudorange-only observations that are typically excluded in traditional PPP processing with precise corrections. Validated with ten vehicle tests under different driving environments, the results show that application of the enhanced PPP approach surpasses the traditional PPP strategy for smartphone tracking through diverse obstruction and multipath profiles, and significant improvements of 64%, 23%, and 46% can be observed in the 95th percentile positioning error, 68th percentile positioning error, and overall root-mean-square (RMS) statistics, respectively. In addition, a new adaptive post-fit residual threshold is introduced to optimize the measurement quality control scheme. The results show that the solutions can be further improved with a 95th percentile positioning error of 1.8 m and overall RMS with 1.4 m for the horizontal component. These combined improvements further increase the utility of PPP processing in smartphone-based mobile positioning for mass-market applications."
